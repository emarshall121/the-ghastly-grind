# The Ghastly Grind - A Simple Calendar Application

<b>Overview</b><br>
The purpose of this project is to create a calendar application that lets a user save events for each hour of the day and uses color coding to indicate whether a task is a past, present, or future task.

<b>Coding Requirements</b><br>
This project gave me starter code that included CSS, HTML, and README files. I used Moment.js to handle the time and date functionality. I also took advantage of the Bootstrap and JQuery libraries to assist in the project.
